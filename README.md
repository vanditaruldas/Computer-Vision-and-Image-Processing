CSE 473/573: Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP)

Humans process large amounts of visual data throughout the lifetime. Vision is the key channel through which humans learn, understand and navigate the world around. To build computers that can match the ability of human vision is still a challenging problem. In this course, we will explore the important topics related to physical, mathematical, and information-processing aspects of the vision. Topics to be covered include image formation, feature detection and matching, segmentation, stereo and 3D vision, object detection and recognition.
